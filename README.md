## A Credit Score Classification Model

The main function of this classification model is to predict an individual's credit score from these factors:
- delay of payments from due date
- number of delayed payments 

The model is built by using the K Nearest Neighbors Classification algorithm, and cross-validation is done to find the "best" value of K for the algorithm.<br />

The dataset that was used was obtained from Kaggle, source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification/data
